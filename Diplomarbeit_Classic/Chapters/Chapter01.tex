\section{Introduction}
Navigation and planning are essential for mobile robots to act in out- and indoor environments. 
Uncountable articles are describing approaches and applied solutions of autonomous system driving safely in different domains, e.g. Stanley \cite{stanley} a self driving car that won the DARPA Grand Challenge by driving 132~miles through the Mojave desert, or the mobile robots of Kiva Systems \cite{kiva} handling goods in distribution centers and warehouses like Amazon. 
Articles like \cite{stanley} and \cite{kiva} present the relationship between the environmental complexity and the computational on-board power needed to deal with it.
Stanley has a six processor computing platform sponsored by Intel whilst Kiva robots are using low cost DSP's for navigation and vision processing\footnote{Kiva Systems Uses "Smart" Blackfin-powered Robots for Warehouse Navigation | Analog Devices: \url{http://www.analog.com/en/content/kiva_systems_bf548/fca.html}} to drive within a known environment. 
The robot shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fig_pioneer} is used on our institute. The robot is able to drive autonomous within our lab/office environment and is equipped with one Intel processor (i5@3,4GHz) running Robotic Operation System (ROS)\footnote{Robot Operating System (ROS): \url{http://ww.ros.org/}}.  
While the application domain and computational power varies strongly between the robotic systems, all of them have to move safely and efficient from one location to another.

A common strategy to deal with the complex planning problem is the division into a global and a local planning problem \cite{LaValle2006}.
Global path-planning requires a simplified representation, e.g. static map, of the search problem to efficiently compute an optimal shortest path using variants of Dijkstra's \cite{dijkstra1959note} or $A^*$ \cite{DBLP:journals/tssc/HartNR68/Astar} algorithm, ignoring kinematic and acceleration constraints of the robot.
In succession the retrieved global path is used by a local planner for guiding the robot through the environment.
%(REMARK: global path planning in la valle, D*, FD* usw. eventuel)%
The local planner takes sensor readings of the robot into account and is reactive to changes within the sensor range. 
It chooses the best values of available motor controls in respect to the kinematic and dynamic constraints of the robot. 
The main task is to avoid collision with obstacles, by generating feasible velocity commands to produce a trajectory for the robot near the global path.
The heuristic strategy presented optimizes the local planner.   

One of the most popular local planer and reactive collision avoidance method is the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA)\cite{DWA1997}. Its based on evaluating a fixed number of trajectory samples in a reduced velocity space. 
A dynamic window around the current robot fused with the current sensor readings of the robot represents a so called costmap.
Trajectories are sampled into that costmap and weighted by a cost function.
Recent adoptions of this method can be found in \cite{conf/icra/SederP07}\cite{DBLP:conf/icra/Marder-EppsteinBFGK10}
%(REMARK: Other methods with fixed sized samples: Curvatur Velocity Method. Lane curvature method, lookup sources, cite resent papers which use this apporaches)

In this paper we propose a method which finds the best velocity commands by using search strategies based on Meta-Heuristics instead of evaluating a fixed number of trajectories in a brute force manner.
A combination of Iterated Local Search (ILS) with different neighborhood structures, Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS), and a Tabu list provides a significant documented performance boost. 

This enables the local planer to:
\begin{itemize}
\item run at a higher frequency
\item simulate trajectories for a longer time interval
\item moving the robot at higher speed
\item investigate a larger amount of trajectories
\item use a higher costmap resolution
\end{itemize}

The next section presents related work, followed by a detailed description of the approach in Section~\ref{sec:Approach}, and results of the experiments are given in Section~\ref{sec:testresults}. 
\section{Related Work} \label{sec:RelatedWork}
Of particular interest are local planning methods which apply sampling and simulation of trajectories. 
Here the maximization step can easily be substituted by the proposed method. The next two section describe the recent developments of this family of planners and gives an introduction to the used Meta-Heuristic algorithm.
