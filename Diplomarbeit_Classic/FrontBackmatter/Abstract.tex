\chapter*{Abstract}
Navigation is a crucial task for mobile robots driving through dynamic environments.
Besides the difficulties involved in finding a way from a starting to some goal location, the problem gets even more difficult if unknown objects, dynamics of the robotic vehicle and uncertainties from sensor readings have to be taken into account.

To guarantee a safe passage common approaches divide the navigation task into two parts - global and local planning.
A global planner finds an initial path to the desired goal location based on a previous obtained map. The retrieved path is used as a guide for a local path planning component.
This local path planner uses local information obtained through recent sensor readings and applies obstacle avoidance strategies to safely and efficiently follow the guide as precise as possible. 

Very effective local planning methods like the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) or Trajectory Roll-out are based on generating and weighting trajectories.
The best trajectory yields the optimal motor controls.
The goal of this thesis is to analyze these approaches and improve the performance of local planners by applying well known meta-heuristic search strategies.
